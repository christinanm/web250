			<h2> Contract </h2> 
            <p>
                I, <a href="introduction.html">Christina N. Mekheil</a>, agree to
                abide by the terms in my Spring 2025 WEB250-N850 Database Driven Websites with my instructor, D.I von Briesen.
              </p>
              <p>
                I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal
                websites will be publicly available to the world.
              </p>
              <p>
                I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork,
                or that I wish to keep private.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not
                logins or showing up for class.
              </p>
              <p>As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>
              <p>Signed: <i>Christina N. Mekheil, 18 January 2025</i></p>
