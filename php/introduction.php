							<li><strong>Background in this Subject:</strong> My interest in computers and IT has been a constant my whole life,
							but I’ve only started programming seriously since the start of my degree here at CPCC.</li> <br>

							<li><strong>Primary Computer Platform: </strong> My primary computer platform is my desktop PC, which runs Windows 11 Home version 23H2.							</li> <br>
