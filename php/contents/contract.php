<p>
I, <a href="?p=introduction">Christina N. Mekheil</a>, agree to
abide by the terms in my Spring 2025 WEB250-N850 Database Driven Websites with my instructor, D.I von Briesen.
</p>
<br>
<p>
I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal
websites will be publicly available to the world.
</p>
<br>
<p>
I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork,
or that I wish to keep private.
</p>
<br>
<p>
I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not
logins or showing up for class.
</p>
<br>
<p>As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>
<br>
