						<li><strong>Personal Backgroud:</strong> I was born and raised in New Jersey, and I’ve been a resident of Charlotte for about 3 years now! I currently work as an IT Support Technician. </li>

						<li><strong>Academic Background:</strong>  I am currently in the AAS program for Full-Stack Programming, which I hope to complete this upcoming year. I’m considering completing an AA degree as well in case I decide on transferring to a 4-year degree, but I’m not sure yet.</li>

						<li><strong>Background in this Subject:</strong> My interest in computers and IT has been a constant my whole life,
							but I’ve only started programming seriously since the start of my degree here at CPCC.</li> 

						<li><strong>Primary Computer Platform: </strong> My primary computer platform is my desktop PC, which runs Windows 11 Home version 23H2.</li> 
                            
						<li><strong>Courses I'm Taking &#38; Why: </strong>
							<ol>

							which causes a lack of hemoglobin as well as healthy red blood cells. Harmless for the most part, though!</li>
